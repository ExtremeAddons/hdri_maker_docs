FAQs
=====================

How many backgrounds are included?
****************************************

At the moment there are almost 500 Backgrounds Included

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can I use the backgrounds for commercial projects?
*******************************************************

Yes, the entire Default library of HDRi Maker is provided under CC0 license, so you can use it even without citing the license. If you want to use the backgrounds contained in the Hdr Maps expansion, you can do it, but you will have to cite the author and the license

In any case I have inserted in each Background the type of license of use. This can be viewed by pressing the Button
"Info" as in the image below, a popup opens, and from there you can see the type of license of use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are updates free?
***********************

HDRi Maker was born in 2019 and since then all users who have purchased the addon have received all updates for free. This means that if you buy the addon today, you will have access to all future updates.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I bought a version that is not PRO, can I upgrade to PRO in the future?
******************************************************************************

Yes, you can do it, you will just have to buy the PRO version and you will only pay the difference in price.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do I have to install all the libraries?
********************************************

No, it is sufficient to install even only the 1k libraries, which occupy less than 1GB, the minimum to have HDRi Maker working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do I need a powerful graphics card?
*****************************************

My advice is undoubtedly yes, but it is not mandatory. The important thing is to have a VRAM large enough, at least 4GB

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How much Video Memory is needed for 16k images?
***********************************************

Technically it would be useful to have at least 8GB of VRAM to run GPU rendering with such high resolutions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With which rendering engines can I use HDRi Maker?
**************************************************

Cycles and Eevee are the rendering engines supported by HDRi Maker, support for other rendering engines is not planned at the moment

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there support?

Can I use HDRi Maker on Software other than Blender?

Can I export the dome as a 3D model?
*******************************************

Not yet, but it is possible that in the future there will be

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can I import videos as backgrounds?
*****************************************

This is not currently planned for 2 reasons. Videos are currently huge in GB quantity, so we have not yet intended
to address the issue. I have also been asked many times if you can import videos made with the normal camera.
The answer is yes, but it doesn't make sense. It's not a VFX addon, so it's not planned to use it.
