This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about Sphinx.  Feel free to

How do I...
-----------


... get section numbers?
   They are automatic in LaTeX output; for HTML, give a ``:numbered:`` option to
   the :rst:dir:`toctree` directive where you want to start numbering.


... add global substitutions or includes?
   Add them in theconfig value.

... display the whole TOC tree in the sidebar?
   Use the :data:`toctree` callable in a custom layout template, probably in the
   ``sidebartoc`` block.


... convert from my existing docs using MoinMoin markup?
   The easiest way is to convert to xhtml, then convert .  You'll
   still need to mark up classes and such, but the headings and code examples
   come through cleanly.
