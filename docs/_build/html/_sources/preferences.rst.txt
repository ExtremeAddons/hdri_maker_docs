   - This is where you can add additional libraries, these libraries must have been made exclusively for HDRi Maker (for the moment)

This section allows you to keep track of the installed libraries, and to check if there are updates for them.
All packages with the green check mark are installed in the addon library. Remember that you must have the libraries connected to the addon to use this menu.

    :alt: Options Tab

General Options
**********************

    - **Show material Popup label**

       - This option allows you to display the name of the material in the popup menu of the material preview.

    - **Icon Preview Dimension**

       - This option allows you to change the size of the material preview in the addon interface.

    - **Icon Popup Size**

       - This option allows you to change the size of the material preview in the popup menu.

    - **Check Update Frequency**

       - This option allows you to change the frequency of the update check. (It is recommended to leave it at "Daily")


Fix Options
***********************

   - **Try to fix unknow nodes**

      - This option allows you to try to fix the nodes of the material if they are not recognized by the Blender.
        Questo pu√≤ succedere se si salva il progetto su versioni successive di Blender in cui ci sono nuovi nodi, e si ritorna alla versioni
        precedenti, in alcuni casi i nodi non sono piu riconosciuti. Questo tenta di sostituire i nodi non riconosciuti.

   - **Try to fix unknow nodes**

      - This option allows you to try to fix the nodes of the material if they are not recognized by the Blender.
        This can happen if you save the project on later versions of Blender where there are new nodes, and return to
        the previous versions, in some cases the nodes are no longer recognized. This tries to replace the unrecognized nodes.


Experimental Options
*************************

   - **Color Space**

      - This option "Very experimental" changes the color space of the images (if there are) HDR used as background.
        By default the color space is "Linear"

   - **Show Creator Utility**

      - This option is what I (Andrew_D creator of this addon) used to facilitate the creation of new libraries and materials / world
        Once activated, you can see in Shader edito, a new panel. This section is really "Dangerous" to use, it could compromise
        The good functioning of HDRi Maker. If you don't know what you're doing, don't touch this option.

   - **Volumetric Detail**

      - This option allows you to use presets created by me, to manage the quality of the volumes.
        The settings range from Very Low to Ultra. Where very low is the lowest quality and Ultra the highest quality.
        This option is also available in the section here: :ref:`volumetric_detail`

   - **Shadow Detail**

      .. note:: This option will no longer be visible in Blender 4.2 as it is no longer needed. Into previous versions of Blender,
                Show Shadow Detail is available.

      - This option allows you to use presets created by me, to manage the quality of the shadows.
        The settings range from Very Low to Ultra. Where very low is the lowest quality and Ultra the highest quality.
        This option is also available in the section here: :ref:`eevee_shadow_detail`
