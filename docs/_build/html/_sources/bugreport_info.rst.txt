Guidelines for bugreport
========================

I can guarantee the resolution of bugs only if the product has been purchased through our official channels
(extreme-addons.com, blendermaket.com, gumroad.com)

In addition, sometimes some versions of Blender are not official, have different APIs from the official version,
unfortunately not always these versions respect the official APIs, and therefore it is not possible to guarantee the
functionality of our addons at 100%, this cannot be considered a bug, but a compatibility problem with
the unofficial versions of Blender in question.

Make sure it's a bug
--------------------

First of all, make sure it's really a bug, and not a configuration or usage problem.
Also check this page: https://github.com/ExtremeAddons/hdri_maker/issues if the bug has not already been reported,
you can start thinking of doing it really.

How to report the bug
---------------------

Method 1:
*********
**( Best Method Requires to be registered on Github )**

If you have installed the HDRi Maker addon and are able to go to its preferences, you can use the "Report Bug" button
it will precompile the bug report so that you only have to enter the description of the bug, and send it.

.. Note::
    If the button does not work, use this link and create a new Report: https://github.com/ExtremeAddons/hdri_maker/issues/new
    if you are not registered on github, you will be asked to register, once registered, you can send the bug report.


Method 2:
*********
**( Not Recommended )**

Use the "System To Clipboard" button to copy the system information, and paste it into the bug report, now you can
paste the system information and think of contacting me on BlenderMarket (If you are a Blendermarket user)
Or you can contact me in the Extreme-Addons chat, you can find it at the bottom right on the website https://extreme-addons.com

.. Note:: For practical reasons, it is better to report bugs via github, this allows you to keep track of all the bugs
          reported by our users, this also allows us to make the solution of bugs public, so that everyone can benefit
          from the reports and check that the bug has been fixed.
