1. Lamps Menu
-------------

Lamps allows you to create a set of lights at your own choice on the fly. It will create a Circle with anchored to it the set of lights.
It has in addition a target point (See yellow arrow in the image) this allows you to keep the lights pointed where you want.
(More you explain how to make the target point parent of the object you want to illuminate in order to be able to point
the lights also on objects that move)

Add-Reload/Remove (1)
*********************

These 2 buttons add or remove the set of lights, the amount of lights depends on the value "Light Count" set.
(At the moment only 1 set of lights can be added HDRiMaker 3.0.100)


Light Count (2)
***************

This value (Integer) changes the number of lights connected to the set of lights, the addon will divide the circle evenly.

.. Note::
    If you increase the number of lights, these new ones will have the same properties as the last one at the bottom of the list.

Lamps (3)
*********

Lamps changes the position of the set of lights on the X-Y-Z axis.

The button next to it (Link) is to link the set of lights to any object selected in the scene, this is useful
to make the set of lights move with the object indicated.

Per rimuovere la parentela, basta cliccare nuovamente sul pulsante "Link" poichè esso stesso è diventato "Unlink".

To unlink from parent object, just click again on the "Link" button because it has become "Unlink" itself.
Take a look in the image below:

Target (4)
**********

Target is the point where the set of lights will be pointed, it is useful to keep the lights pointed at the object
you want to illuminate.

The target is an empty object that is created automatically when you add the set of lights, it is anchored to the set of lights.

Like a Lamps, the button next to it (Link) is to link the target to any object selected in the scene, this is useful
to make the target move with the object indicated in order to keep the lights pointed at the object you want to illuminate when it moves.

Light Type / Area Shape (5)
***************************

Light type allows you to choose between many types of lights:
 - Area: Enum into next property (Square, Disc, Rectangle, Ellipse)
 - Spot
 - Point

Depending on the type of light chosen, the panel below with the properties of the lights will change.

.. Note::
    Area type have a property called "Area Shape" that allows you to choose between 4 different shapes:
    (Square, Disc, Rectangle, Ellipse)

Lights Properties (6)
*********************

This panel allows you to modify the values of the properties of each single light or all the lights together.

2. Sun Menu

3. Eevee Shadow Detail
----------------------

This is a selector of Eevee shadow detail level. I compiled in it some presets that automatically modify the settings
of the Eevee shadow detail level (Only works with Eevee)

Enum In (Very Low, Low, Default, High, Very High, Ultra)

The level of detail greatly affects the performance of Eevee, so it is necessary to choose carefully the level of detail,
it can be changed at any time.
