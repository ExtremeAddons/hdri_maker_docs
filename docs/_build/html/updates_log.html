<h2>3.0.113<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 29-07-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix Json Save</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the saving of json files, it could happen that if blender stopped abnormally, the json file would be corrupted. Now a temporary saving system has been implemented, only if the writing is successful, the file is then converted to json. This to avoid corrupted files</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Error during the creation of the Asset Browser</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In some cases (Probably still to be fully understood) the process was blocked by an error if the background file was not present in the library folder, so an exception was put, in case it occurred, the process bypasses the background and continues</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvement - Added additional warning if the background file is not present</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As described in the previous point, if the preview file is not present, by pressing the ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô button an additional message will now be shown informing in which exapack volume the missing background is present, so that you can download only that package</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="id2">
<h2>3.0.112<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 14-07-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Alpha - Beta Version Alert Message added</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If the version of Blender used is a Beta or Alpha version, a message will be displayed in the main interface of the addon, a confirmation button will hide the message until the next start of Blender, this has been added because many users try the new unstable versions of Blender and sometimes the addons don‚Äôt work, I hope this message is useful</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Node Alignment improved</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Added a function that better calculates the size of the nodes, even in conditions where the nodes are not displayed, the node.dimensions property does not work until the nodes are displayed, a log with the dimensions of the nodes has been added via file.json</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Add background reset the orientation and the other properties</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you add an HDR in version 1k and then replace it with the same background at another resolution (For example 4k) the background rotation was reset, this no longer happens, the rotation remains unchanged and also the other properties</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvement - Library paths updated when the addon is activated</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When the addon is activated with the checkbox, if it was already activated before, it now updates the library paths and you don‚Äôt have to reassign the paths. This only happens if HDRi Maker was already installed and with the library paths already assigned (It only works if the paths were assigned in the previous 3.x version)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Error Index negative during Add Hooks in Blender 3.6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For some reason, the vertex indices of the Dome, changed to negative indices during the compilation of the vertex list and the assignment of a Modifier for each Hook. Now the list is compiled in a further step and the indices no longer change.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.0.111<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 08-05-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Error During Asset Browser Creation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In some cases (Probably still to be fully understood) it showed a mat_info.get() error, this is because an exception had not been set to check if mat_info really existed. It has now been fixed and the error will no longer appear</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Remind me later button</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In order to hide the update message (If the addon need update) a new button has been added to the message, this button will hide the message in the current Blender Session</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - check_existing Error</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>During the creation of the Asset Browser In versions prior to Blender 3.4 an error (check_existing) occurred, this was due to the fact that the check_existing parameter was not present in the bpy.ops.preferences.asset_library_add operator, now this parameter has been removed if the Blender version is prior to 3.4</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>3.0.110<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 29-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Added - Creation of library in Asset Browser</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For now it is limited to Worlds only, if drag and drop is done, only the world is added. All other features need to be added via the HDRi Maker panel. This python API limitation of Asset Browser.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Convert World to HDRi Maker World</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now if the World is not of type HDRi Maker, the usual menu appears in the HDRi Maker World panel, with a button called TRY TO CONVERT, this operator, attempts to convert any World to an HDRi Maker Wordl. This will only work if there is an HDR/EXR File in the World. This for obvious reasons, first of all, will allow you to use some functions present only if the group nodes are recognized by HDRi maker.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Added - Reload Dome Image</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A new Reload Image button has been added to the Dome menu. This is useful if you work with asset browsers, once any World (even of a non-HDRi Maker type) has been added, it can also be added to the dome, without necessarily having to add a new dome. This works provided that in the World Added to the scene, there is an HDR or EXR image inside the World nodes.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>3.0.105<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 16-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Pose Mode Bug</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If in Pose Mode, trying to add Backgrouns-Dome-Lamps, an error occurred. This has now been fixed, if you are in pose mode and do one of the above operations, the object goes back to Edit Mode, and the script executes correctly.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New feature - Dome Rotation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A property has been added to rotate the Dome, this is useful, because when the Hooks are applied, now the Hook will rotate with the dome, in order not to have to rotate the objects in the scene</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bug Fix - Installation User Library Missing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It could happen that during the first installation, the user chose the USER_LIBRARY directory, in a non-existent location, this did not start HDRi Maker and had to be removed, then add the USER LIBRARY, now this is solved, The addon if it sees that there is no USER Library In the chosen path, it will create it automatically during installation (Exapack installation) This already happened, but only if no User Library path was selected</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improvement - Save the Expansion Library directories</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When you update the addon from version 3.x and up of HDRi Maker, the addon now also saves the directories and names of the Expansion Library, so that if you update the addon, you do not have to re-indicate the paths of the Expansion Library. Now all directories are stored in a json file, in order to simplify the update phase of the addon. Even when you switch to a later version of Blender, the addon always recognizes the directories, as long as they still exist and have not been moved on the computer to another location</p>

<h2>3.0.104<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 03-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - Retrocompatibility Dome Material</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Dome material was reflective on Blender versions 3.0 to 3.3 (Not on 3.4) Fixed issue, it was the Mix nodes that didn‚Äôt have proper input and black was grayed out, causing reflection to always be on, and also the metallic. Now everything should work from Blender 3.0 and up. Previous versions have been abandoned, as they are now obsolete. a positive note for the support of Blender 3.3 which is an LTS release, so it is necessary to make HDRi Maker workable on it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.0.103<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 03-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix - (Choose path) For Mac and Linux</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For some reason, it was no longer possible to select the library paths. I had used the ntpath.normpath module to make sure I normalized the paths. It worked during testing, but now it doesn‚Äôt work anymore on Mac and Linux. Maybe I missed something. The new version checks the path with os.path.normpath. You should now be able to select the path to the libraries correctly</p>

<h2>3.0.102<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Release date: 02-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix when installing expansions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It could happen that during the installation of Expansions, if they were already present on the disk and not in the list of HDRi Maker expansions, they were installed in the Default library. This could rarely happen, only if they had already been installed before. I fixed this to avoid potential confusion in some rare cases.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bugfix: Removes files of expansion volumes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Expansion volumes were not removed from the Updates menu, they can now be removed.</p>

<p><strong>Release date: 01-03-2023 (D/M/Y)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Installation Bugfix for Mac-Linux</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For some reason, using os.path.realpath didn‚Äôt work well on Mac and Linux. It has been replaced with ntpath.normpath module, this blocked the installation of files.exapack now it‚Äôs back it works on Win-Mac-Linux</p>
